fiona is api to GDAL
fiona doesn't work with GDAL200.dll, it only works with lower vision
if installing fiona from conda installation, fiona is linked to GDAL*.dll which is located in c:/Anaconda2/Library/bin as libgdal is downloaded together with fiona and tells fiona 
where dll resides

if download fiona.whl(compiled files) and install alone,fiona looks for gdal*.dll in GDDAL installation directorY[c:\Program Files\GDAL\]

no matter what, fiona looks for 1.11.3 version gdal library(dll), doesn't matter where it is located, as long as fiona can find it.
not 100% sure how fiona hooks up with gdal**.dll, maybe through os.path? maybe gdal python binding tells fiona when they are installed ??????
